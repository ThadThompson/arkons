ARK Remote Console Commands

Recommend using PyCharm for editing and running Python scripts, and Anaconda as the Python distribution:

The main script here is `ArkCon.py`. It uses a an RCON client to rapidly send a set of commands to the ARK server to give players gear sets. It's got a lot of hacking in there, and I had to lookup the entity IDs from a couple of places. Also: you need everyone's SteamID, but it's still got several of ours from years ago.
